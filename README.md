## About <a name = "about"></a>

Our machine learning project, called an "art classification model" is intended to identify or categorize works of art according to their visual features. It analyzes and extracts information from photographs of artworks using computer vision techniques and algorithms, allowing the model to learn patterns and forecast the class or category that an artwork belongs to. Please feel free to reach out to any of the colaborators should you have any questions regarding the project.
